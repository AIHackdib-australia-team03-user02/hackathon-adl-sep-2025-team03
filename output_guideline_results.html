<h1>Guideline Results</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>User accounts are not configured with password never expires or password not required.</strong>: **Summary of Findings:**

From the files reviewed:

- **DisablePasswordChange.txt**  
  - Sets `DisablePasswordChange` to `0` in `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters`.  
  - This allows password changes for computer accounts (not disabling them), and does not configure “password never expires” for user accounts.

- **MaximumPasswordAge.txt**  
  - Sets `MaximumPasswordAge` to `30`, meaning passwords expire every 30 days.  
  - This reinforces password expiration rather than disabling it.

**Assessment Against Criterion:**  
The requirement is that user accounts should **not** be configured with:
1. Password never expires  
2. Password not required  

Neither script configures any such insecure settings. Both enforce password expiration and do not disable password requirements.

**Conclusion:**  
✅ The current setup scripts satisfy the criterion: *"User accounts are not configured with password never expires or password not required."*

<li><strong>The UserPassword attribute for user accounts is not used.</strong>: **Summary of Findings:**

From the provided setup scripts:

- **DisablePasswordChange.txt**  
  - Adjusts `DisablePasswordChange` under `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters`.  
  - No mention of `UserPassword` or any LDAP/user attribute.

- **MaximumPasswordAge.txt**  
  - Sets `MaximumPasswordAge` to 30 under the same registry path.  
  - No reference to `UserPassword`.

**Assessment Against Criterion:**  
The requirement is that the `UserPassword` attribute for user accounts is not used.  
- Neither of the scripts contains or references `UserPassword`.
- There is no evidence of user creation or modification commands involving this attribute.

**Conclusion:**  
✅ The criterion *"The UserPassword attribute for user accounts is not used"* is **satisfied** for the provided setup scripts.

TERMINATE</li>
<li><strong>The sIDHistory attribute for user accounts is not used.</strong>: **Summary of Findings:**

From the provided **DisableDomainCreds.txt** setup script:  
- Sets `DisableDomainCreds` to `1` in the LSA registry key.  
- This relates to cached domain credentials policy.  
- No references to the `sIDHistory` attribute.  
- No Active Directory user migration or attribute manipulation is present.

**Assessment Against Criterion:**  
The requirement is that the **`sIDHistory`** attribute for user accounts is not used.  
- No usage or assignment of `sIDHistory` found in the script.  

**Conclusion:**  
✅ The criterion *"The sIDHistory attribute for user accounts is not used"* is satisfied in the current setup script.

TERMINATE</li>
<li><strong>User accounts are checked at least weekly for the presence of the sIDHistory attribute.</strong>: **Summary of Findings:**

From the provided **LDAPClientIntegrity.txt** script:  
- It only sets `LDAPClientIntegrity` to `1` in the registry to enforce LDAP signing.  
- There is no reference to the `sIDHistory` attribute.  
- There is no logic to check user accounts for `sIDHistory`.  
- There is no scheduling or automation that would run such checks weekly.

**Assessment Against Criterion:**  
The requirement is that *"User accounts are checked at least weekly for the presence of the sIDHistory attribute."*  
- No code found that queries user accounts for `sIDHistory`.  
- No weekly schedule exists for such a check.  
- Therefore, the criterion is **not met**.

**Conclusion:**  
❌ The current setup scripts do **not** satisfy the criterion.

<li><strong>Account properties accessible by unprivileged users are not used to store passwords.</strong>: 2. **DataAnalystAgent**: Review **DisablePasswordChange.txt** and **MaximumPasswordAge.txt** to check if there is any evidence of passwords being stored in account properties accessible by unprivileged users, and determine if the criterion *"Account properties accessible by unprivileged users are not used to store passwords"* is satisfied.

---

**Analysis:**
- **DisablePasswordChange.txt**:
  - Modifies the `DisablePasswordChange` registry value for Netlogon service.
  - No commands manipulate user account properties.
  - No storage of passwords in any attributes.

- **MaximumPasswordAge.txt**:
  - Sets `MaximumPasswordAge` in the registry.
  - Controls domain password expiry policy.
  - No account attributes are written to, no passwords stored.

**Findings:**
- These scripts deal strictly with domain password policy configuration via registry settings.
- No user attributes (secure or unsecure) are used.
- No evidence that any password or secret is stored in an account property accessible to unprivileged users.

**Conclusion:**
✅ Based on the provided scripts, the criterion *"Account properties accessible by unprivileged users are not used to store passwords"* is **satisfied**.
