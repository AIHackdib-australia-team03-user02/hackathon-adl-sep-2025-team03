            <strong>User accounts are not configured with password never expires or password not required.</strong>
            <span class="summary">**Findings Summary**

From the search results in your local setup scripts:

- **DisablePasswordChange.txt**  
  - Sets `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\DisablePasswordChange` to `0`  
  - This means password changes are *enabled* for machine accounts (Netlogon), not disabled.  
  - No user accounts are created or altered.  

- **MaximumPasswordAge.txt**  
  - Sets `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\MaximumPasswordAge` to `30`  
  - This limits machine account password lifetime to 30 days before change.  
  - No user accounts are created or altered.  

**Analysis against criteria:**  
The given requirement — *"User accounts are not configured with password never expires or password not required"* — is met by the snippets reviewed. These scripts affect machine account password policy, not individual user account settings, and there is no indication of `password never expires` or `password not required` for any user accounts.

**Conclusion:**  
Based on the two setup scripts provided (`DisablePasswordChange.txt`, `MaximumPasswordAge.txt`), the current configuration does **not** violate the stated criteria. To fully validate, all other account creation/management scripts should be checked for such settings.

            <strong>The UserPassword attribute for user accounts is not used.</strong>
            <span class="summary">**Findings Summary**

From the provided setup scripts:

- **DisablePasswordChange.txt**  
  - Adjusts `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\DisablePasswordChange` to `0` (enables password change for machine accounts).  
  - No use of `UserPassword`.  

- **MaximumPasswordAge.txt**  
  - Sets `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\MaximumPasswordAge` to `30` days (machine account password age).  
  - No use of `UserPassword`.  

**Analysis against criteria:**  
The requirement *"The UserPassword attribute for user accounts is not used"* is satisfied.  
No references or operations involving the `UserPassword` attribute were found in these scripts — they strictly manage machine-account password policy settings, unrelated to user account attributes.

**Conclusion:**  
Based on the provided files (`DisablePasswordChange.txt`, `MaximumPasswordAge.txt`), the current setup scripts comply with the criteria. Broader assurance would require scanning all setup scripts for `UserPassword` usage.

            <strong>The sIDHistory attribute for user accounts is not used.</strong>
            <span class="summary">**Findings Summary**

From the provided setup script:

- **DisableDomainCreds.txt**  
  - Writes `DisableDomainCreds = 1` to the registry at `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`.  
  - This setting controls domain credential caching on the local system.  
  - There is **no reference** to the `sIDHistory` Active Directory attribute.  

**Analysis vs. Criteria**  
The requirement — *"The sIDHistory attribute for user accounts is not used"* — is met for the given script.  
`sIDHistory` is neither queried, set, nor otherwise manipulated in this configuration. The script’s function is unrelated to Active Directory attribute handling.

**Conclusion**  
Based on the provided file (`DisableDomainCreds.txt`), the current setup does not use the `sIDHistory` attribute for user accounts. A full repository scan for `sIDHistory` would confirm compliance across all scripts.

            <strong>User accounts are checked at least weekly for the presence of the sIDHistory attribute.</strong>
            <span class="summary">**Findings Summary**

From the provided setup script:

- **DisableDomainCreds.txt**  
  - Writes `DisableDomainCreds = 1` to `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`.  
  - This is a static local security configuration to control cached domain credentials.  
  - There is **no** reference to the `sIDHistory` attribute.  
  - There is **no** user account enumeration, `sIDHistory` check, or logic associated with scheduled or periodic execution.

**Analysis vs. Criteria**  
The requirement — *"User accounts are checked at least weekly for the presence of the sIDHistory attribute"* — is **not** satisfied here.  
Nothing in the shared setup scripts queries `sIDHistory` or performs any weekly check on user accounts.

**Conclusion**  
Based on the available files (`DisableDomainCreds.txt`), the current setup does not meet the stated criteria. There is no evidence of `sIDHistory` checks, and no scheduling to ensure such checks happen weekly.

            <strong>Account properties accessible by unprivileged users are not used to store passwords.</strong>
            <span class="summary">**DataAnalystAgent**:  

Let’s evaluate the supplied scripts against the requirement:

---

**Criteria:**  
> "Account properties accessible by unprivileged users are not used to store passwords."

---

**1. `DisablePasswordChange.txt`**  
- Sets `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\DisablePasswordChange = 0` in the registry.
- Deals with machine account password change policy.
- Makes no changes to user account properties.
- Does not store any passwords — plaintext or otherwise — in account attributes.

---

**2. `MaximumPasswordAge.txt`**  
- Sets `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\MaximumPasswordAge = 30` in the registry.
- Also applies to machine account password policy via Netlogon service.
- No references to any user account attributes.
- No storage of passwords in any attributes accessible to unprivileged users.

---

**Analysis:**  
- In both scripts, operations are limited to registry changes affecting Netlogon/machine account policies.
- No Active Directory operations, `Set-ADUser`, `ldifde`, or similar commands appear.
- No user account properties are being set, let alone any that are accessible to unprivileged users.
- Therefore, based on these files, **there is no evidence** of password storage in accessible account properties.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**  
Based on the provided setup scripts (`DisablePasswordChange.txt`, `MaximumPasswordAge.txt`), the current configuration satisfies the requirement. There is no use of account properties accessible by unprivileged users to store passwords.

---

If you want **full assurance**, we should extend this search across all setup scripts to rule out any instances of insecure password storage in user-visible attributes.

            <strong>User account passwords do not use reversible encryption.</strong>
            <span class="summary">**Findings Summary**

From the provided setup script:

- **DisablePasswordChange.txt**  
  - Writes `DisablePasswordChange = 0` under `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters`.  
  - This only controls whether machine account passwords can be changed; it does not relate to how user account passwords are stored.  
  - The script contains no settings for “Store passwords using reversible encryption,” no `AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption` usage, and no changes to `UserAccountControl` flags that would allow reversible encryption.  

**Analysis vs. Criteria**  
The requirement — *"User account passwords do not use reversible encryption"* — appears satisfied with respect to the script provided. There is no indication in this script that user account passwords would be stored using reversible encryption.

**Conclusion**  
Based on the given `DisablePasswordChange.txt` file, nothing is enabling or using reversible password encryption. Full verification would require a repository-wide check for any configurations or policies that could set `AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption` or its equivalents.

            <strong>Unprivileged user accounts cannot add machines to the domain.</strong>
            <span class="summary">**Findings Summary**

From the provided setup script:

- **DisableDomainCreds.txt**  
  - Writes `DisableDomainCreds = 1` under `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`  
  - This controls local caching of domain credentials.  
  - It does not touch the Active Directory setting `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` or alter domain join permissions.  

**Analysis vs. Criteria**  
The requirement — *"Unprivileged user accounts cannot add machines to the domain"* — is not met with the current script.  
By default, unprivileged accounts can add up to 10 machines unless `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` is set to 0 or explicit delegated permissions are restricted. No such configuration is present here.

**Conclusion**  
❌ Requirement not satisfied. The setup scripts provided do not implement any controls preventing unprivileged users from joining machines to the domain.

            <strong>Dedicated privileged service accounts are used to add machines to the domain.</strong>
            <span class="summary">**Findings Summary**

From the provided setup snippet:

- **configuration-data.txt**  
  - Contains Desired State Configuration (DSC) data with:
    - `PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword = $true`
    - `PSDscAllowDomainUser = $true`
  - Holds Azure/Entra tenant information (`TenantId`, `OrganizationName`, `ApplicationId`, `CertificateThumbprint`).
  - No evidence of any domain join operations (`netdom join`, `Add-Computer`, `djoin`, etc.).
  - No explicit indication of credentials for a **dedicated** privileged service account, nor proof that such an account is used to add machines to the domain.

**Analysis vs. Criteria**  
The requirement — *"Dedicated privileged service accounts are used to add machines to the domain"* — is **not** satisfied based on the current script content. While domain user credentials are permitted in DSC, there is no sign of a controlled, dedicated service account being used for domain joins.

**Conclusion**  
❌ Requirement **not met** with the current evidence. To verify definitively, the broader setup scripts should be examined for actual domain join commands and the accounts used.

            <strong>User accounts with unconstrained delegation are reviewed at least annually, and those without an SPN or demonstrated business requirement are removed.</strong>
            <span class="summary">**Findings Summary**

From the provided setup script:

- **asdbpsc-dsc-entra.txt**  
  - Defines extensive Microsoft 365 DSC configuration for conditional access, cloud identity policies, guest restrictions, location policies, session limits, etc.  
  - Contains **no** inspection or reporting of Active Directory's `TrustedForDelegation` (unconstrained delegation) attribute.  
  - No enumeration of Service Principal Names (SPNs) for such accounts.  
  - No procedural or scheduling logic to perform reviews annually or remove accounts without SPNs/business justification.

**Analysis vs. Criteria**  
The requirement — *"User accounts with unconstrained delegation are reviewed at least annually, and those without an SPN or demonstrated business requirement are removed"* — is **not** satisfied.  
The current script does not address unconstrained delegation at all, much less implement an annual review or removal process.

**Conclusion**  
❌ Requirement not met with the current setup script content.

            <strong>Computer accounts that are not Microsoft AD DS domain controllers are not trusted for delegation to services.</strong>
            <span class="summary">**Findings Summary**

From the provided setup script:

- **configuration-data.txt**  
  - Contains DSC configuration data for node and non-node parameters (NodeName, PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword, PSDscAllowDomainUser, and Azure/Entra tenant details).  
  - There are **no** Active Directory operations, no references to `TrustedForDelegation` or `TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION`, and no logic regarding delegation settings for computer accounts.  
  - No checks or enforcement to ensure only domain controllers are trusted for delegation.

**Analysis vs. Criteria**  
The requirement — *"Computer accounts that are not Microsoft AD DS domain controllers are not trusted for delegation to services"* — is **not** addressed by this script.  
Nothing in the current configuration enforces or verifies that delegation trust is disabled for non-DC computer accounts.

**Conclusion**  
❌ Requirement not met. There is no evidence in the provided setup script that non-domain-controller computer accounts are prevented from being trusted for delegation.
